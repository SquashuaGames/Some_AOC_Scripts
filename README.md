Blah blah blah

I think you get the gist of what this is. I want to learn how to use github so i can get a job in the game industry. 

Regardless of that, I might also put a demo of this game (Agents of C.H.A.O.S.) on github later. 

For now... I'll keep working on it. 
When all is said and done this stuff here isn't really meant to be used for anything other than learning the site and maybe a personal backup.

That is all.
